One of my classes this semester we are not being given a study guide or any practice questions, just the promise that the test will cover every chapter of the book we covered in class. 

I consulted with my friend chatgpt and we came up with a method to test in studying efficiently through a textbook only.

Below is the plan and in due time, below that will be the results. 

---

*Hypothetically this class has 20 chapters. Midterm 1 was over chapters 1-10 and the final will be over 10-20.*

1. Make a list of all the chapters and mark them:
	1. Green - “I could probably do basic problems”
	2. Yellow - “I kind of understand but struggle”
	3. Red - “I’m lost / avoid this topic”
2. Priority Study Order
	1. red content not in previous midterm
	2. yellow content not in previous midterm
	3. red content in previous midterm
	4. all else 
3. Pick 2 easy, 4 medium, 2-4 hard (most textbooks are ascending)
